# What is Floyd-Warshal algorithm and for what we use it
The **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** is a classic and efficient algorithm used to solve the **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)** problem for a weighted graph. This means it finds the shortest path between **every pair of vertices** in a graph, even if the graph contains negative edge weights (though it cannot handle negative cycles). It is an excellent example of a dynamic programming algorithm, which works by iteratively improving the estimation of the shortest path between all pairs of vertices, allowing only a specific subset of vertices $\{1, 2, \dots, k\}$ to be used as **intermediate nodes** in each phase $k$. The algorithm has a time complexity of $\mathbf{\Theta(n^3)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, making it suitable for dense graphs or graphs where the total number of edges is high.
